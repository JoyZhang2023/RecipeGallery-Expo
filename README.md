 AD340 assignment

## Expo Project
### Start the development server
To start the development server, run the following command:

`npx expo start`

When you run the above command, the Expo CLI starts Metro Bundler. This bundler is an HTTP server that compiles the JavaScript code of your app using Babel and serves it to the Expo app. See how Expo Development Server works for more information about this process.

### Open the app on your device
To open the app on your device that has Expo Go already installed:

On your Android device, press Scan QR Code on the Home tab of the Expo Go app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal.
On your iPhone or iPad, open the default Apple Camera app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal.
You can open the project on multiple devices simultaneously. Go ahead and try it on both phones at the same time if you have them handy.

## Assignment Objective:
Develop an Expo React application that showcases an interactive recipe gallery. The gallery will display images from a predefined list, and users will be able to navigate through the images using "Next" and "Previous" buttons. This assignment will demonstrate your ability to use React state to manage dynamic content and respond to user actions.
